#### _Capstone *10.10.2019*_

#### By _Jessica Doss_

## Description
_This application was created to demonstrate skills learned while studying UI/UX packages and implement foundational code I have learned at Epicodus._

## What I worked on Friday the 20th

_From 8:00am to 5:30pm I worked on the Udemy Advance CSS and SASS:Flexbox, Grid and Animations course. I praticed mixins for responsiveness for my capstone. This is not on my capstone project yet, I followed along with the video on a project they had me create._

## What I worked on Friday the 27th

_From 9:00-11:00am I met with a design lead from a digital agency about guidance on creating my UI package for my capstone._

_From 11:00am-1:00pm I worked on creating a user flow map for my application._

_From 1:00pm-3:30pm I researched more videos and blogs for resources on what to include in my UI package._

_From 3:30pm-5:30pm I created some rough wireframes that will be in my UI pacakge._

## Site Design

_I wanted to make this site feel like a real world application that you would use if you're someone that likes to save on travel by using multiple airlines to get the best deal._
